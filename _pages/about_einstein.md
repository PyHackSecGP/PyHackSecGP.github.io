Cybersecurity is more than a career; it's a commitment to protecting data, systems, and infrastructure from evolving threats. In this repository, you will find:

    Practical Projects: Real-world penetration tests, vulnerability assessments, malware analysis demos, and more.
    Learning Modules: Documentation of courses, labs, and certifications (e.g., OSCP, CEH, CISSP).
    Research & Writing: Articles, blogs, and whitepapers addressing current challenges and breakthroughs in cybersecurity.

My mission is to blend technical skills with continuous learning to contribute towards a safer digital world.

aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaWrite your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
