The Privacy Spectrum: Choose Your Level of Commitment
Bazzell doesn’t offer a one-size-fits-all approach. Instead, he presents a hierarchy of options depending on how far you’re willing — or needing — to go.
1. GrapheneOS on a Pixel Device (Most Private)
This is the nuclear option for mobile privacy. GrapheneOS is a custom version of Android with all Google services stripped out. It’s designed for hardened security, encrypted communications, and zero telemetry.
Pros:
Completely de-Googled
Verified boot security
Minimal background processes
F-Droid and Aurora Store for anonymous apps
Cons:
No push notifications for most apps
Requires a Pixel phone (preferably new and paid in cash)
Technical installation process
2. LineageOS / Custom ROMs
If you can’t get a Pixel, your next best bet is a custom ROM like LineageOS. It’s also free from Google’s grip, but you’ll sacrifice some security since the bootloader remains unlocked (which increases vulnerability to physical tampering).
Great for people who want more control and fewer limitations than stock Android.
3. Manual Debloating (Stock Android)
Already have a phone you like? You can use ADB tools to strip out Google services, Facebook bloatware, and manufacturer apps.
It’s not perfect — Google’s core frameworks still exist — but it’s far better than doing nothing. You can even disable specific trackers and create app sandboxing for isolation.
Tip: Use apps like Blokada or AdGuard DNS to block known tracking domains at the OS level.
4. A Hardened iPhone (If You Must)
Some people won’t let go of iOS, and Bazzell gets that. While Apple collects less data than Google, it still builds detailed behavioral profiles.
To reduce your exposure:
Create a new Apple ID anonymously
Use prepaid iTunes cards (not your real credit card)
Disable iCloud, Siri, FaceTime, iMessage, and every tracking toggle in Settings
Use apps like Signal and ProtonMail for communication
iPhones can be made private, but never fully anonymous. They require an active Apple ID to function properly — an unavoidable digital fingerprint.
Anonymous Cellular Service
Privacy doesn’t stop at the device — it extends to the network.
If you buy your phone with a credit card and sign up for Verizon in your real name, all your efforts are already compromised. That’s why Bazzell recommends using Mint Mobile, a prepaid carrier that offers anonymous activation and solid T-Mobile coverage.
How to Go Anonymous:
Purchase Mint SIM card in-store (Best Buy or Target) with cash
Use public Wi-Fi to activate the card via the Mint app
Never use the carrier-assigned number for calls or texts
Even better: don’t make calls or texts the traditional way at all. Enter…
VOIP: Your New Secret Weapon
Bazzell’s strategy for calls and SMS is a game-changer: Use VOIP (Voice Over Internet Protocol) through services like Twilio.
Why VOIP?
Your phone number is no longer tied to your carrier
You can use multiple numbers for different personas
Calls and texts can be made through desktop or mobile apps
Easily disable a number that gets spammed or compromised
Tools you’ll need:
Twilio for number provisioning and call routing
for number provisioning and call routing Linphone app for making/receiving VOIP calls
app for making/receiving VOIP calls ProtonMail or Tutanota for encrypted email
or for encrypted email Signal for secure messaging
Bazzell outlines step-by-step how to configure Twilio to route calls through Linphone, giving you a personal, encrypted phone line without needing Google or Apple in the loop.
Living Without Push Notifications
One of the biggest trade-offs with GrapheneOS and similar setups is the absence of push notifications. That means no alerts when an email or message arrives — unless you open the app yourself.
At first, this can feel jarring. But over time, it becomes liberating.
Bazzell compares it to early internet days:
“Back then, you checked your inbox on your terms. Now, your inbox checks you.”
This lifestyle forces digital boundaries. Your attention isn’t hijacked by every app vying for your dopamine. You reclaim your time — and your sanity.
