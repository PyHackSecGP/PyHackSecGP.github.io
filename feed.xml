Instead, he presents a hierarchy of options depending on how far you‚Äôre willing ‚Äî or needing ‚Äî to go.</p> <ol> <li>GrapheneOS on a Pixel Device (Most Private) This is the nuclear option for mobile privacy. GrapheneOS is a custom version of Android with all Google services stripped out. It‚Äôs designed for hardened security, encrypted communications, and zero telemetry. Pros: Completely de-Googled Verified boot security Minimal background processes F-Droid and Aurora Store for anonymous apps Cons: No push notifications for most apps Requires a Pixel phone (preferably new and paid in cash) Technical installation process</li> <li>LineageOS / Custom ROMs If you can‚Äôt get a Pixel, your next best bet is a custom ROM like LineageOS. It‚Äôs also free from Google‚Äôs grip, but you‚Äôll sacrifice some security since the bootloader remains unlocked (which increases vulnerability to physical tampering). Great for people who want more control and fewer limitations than stock Android.</li> <li>Manual Debloating (Stock Android) Already have a phone you like? You can use ADB tools to strip out Google services, Facebook bloatware, and manufacturer apps. It‚Äôs not perfect ‚Äî Google‚Äôs core frameworks still exist ‚Äî but it‚Äôs far better than doing nothing. You can even disable specific trackers and create app sandboxing for isolation. Tip: Use apps like Blokada or AdGuard DNS to block known tracking domains at the OS level.</li> <li>A Hardened iPhone (If You Must) Some people won‚Äôt let go of iOS, and Bazzell gets that. While Apple collects less data than Google, it still builds detailed behavioral profiles. To reduce your exposure: Create a new Apple ID anonymously Use prepaid iTunes cards (not your real credit card) Disable iCloud, Siri, FaceTime, iMessage, and every tracking toggle in Settings Use apps like Signal and ProtonMail for communication iPhones can be made private, but never fully anonymous. They require an active Apple ID to function properly ‚Äî an unavoidable digital fingerprint. Anonymous Cellular Service Privacy doesn‚Äôt stop at the device ‚Äî it extends to the network. If you buy your phone with a credit card and sign up for Verizon in your real name, all your efforts are already compromised. That‚Äôs why Bazzell recommends using Mint Mobile, a prepaid carrier that offers anonymous activation and solid T-Mobile coverage. How to Go Anonymous: Purchase Mint SIM card in-store (Best Buy or Target) with cash Use public Wi-Fi to activate the card via the Mint app Never use the carrier-assigned number for calls or texts Even better: don‚Äôt make calls or texts the traditional way at all. Enter‚Ä¶ VOIP: Your New Secret Weapon Bazzell‚Äôs strategy for calls and SMS is a game-changer: Use VOIP (Voice Over Internet Protocol) through services like Twilio. Why VOIP? Your phone number is no longer tied to your carrier You can use multiple numbers for different personas Calls and texts can be made through desktop or mobile apps Easily disable a number that gets spammed or compromised Tools you‚Äôll need: Twilio for number provisioning and call routing for number provisioning and call routing Linphone app for making/receiving VOIP calls app for making/receiving VOIP calls ProtonMail or Tutanota for encrypted email or for encrypted email Signal for secure messaging Bazzell outlines step-by-step how to configure Twilio to route calls through Linphone, giving you a personal, encrypted phone line without needing Google or Apple in the loop. Living Without Push Notifications One of the biggest trade-offs with GrapheneOS and similar setups is the absence of push notifications. That means no alerts when an email or message arrives ‚Äî unless you open the app yourself. At first, this can feel jarring. But over time, it becomes liberating. Bazzell compares it to early internet days: ‚ÄúBack then, you checked your inbox on your terms. Now, your inbox checks you.‚Äù This lifestyle forces digital boundaries. Your attention isn‚Äôt hijacked by every app vying for your dopamine. You reclaim your time ‚Äî and your sanity.</li> </ol>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Originally published on Medium.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Archetype‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäHackTheBox Walkthrough</title><link href="https://pyhacksecgp.github.io/blog/2025/archetype-hackthebox-walkthrough/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Archetype‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäHackTheBox Walkthrough"/><published>2025-04-19T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2025-04-19T00:00:00-07:00</updated><id>https://pyhacksecgp.github.io/blog/2025/archetype-hackthebox-walkthrough</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://pyhacksecgp.github.io/blog/2025/archetype-hackthebox-walkthrough/"><![CDATA[<p><em>Originally published on <a href="https://medium.com/@dazzled_mint_wildebeest_745/archetype-hackthebox-walkthrough-c7470cf6b556?source=rss-9499e60cb547------2">Medium</a>.</em></p> <dl> <dt>Archetype ‚Äî HackTheBox Walkthrough Gurpreet Singh Follow 4 min read ¬∑ Apr 19, 2025 ‚Äì Listen Share</dt> <dt>üåü Introduction</dt> <dt>Archetype is a classic beginner-friendly Windows machine from HackTheBox that teaches important skills like SMB enumeration, MSSQL exploitation, reverse shell techniques, and local privilege escalation.

But what if doing nothing is actually essential to our well-being, creativity, and overall happiness? In many Eastern philosophies, stillness and silence are not voids to be avoided, but spaces to be embraced. Moments of quiet allow us to reconnect with ourselves, process our thoughts, and recharge our mental and emotional batteries. In fact, scientific studies have shown that downtime can boost creativity, improve memory, and reduce stress. Yet, culturally, we reward hustle. We glorify multitasking and celebrate being busy as a status symbol. This mindset not only exhausts us, but it also diminishes our capacity to be fully present and engaged in the moments that matter most. Imagine what would happen if, instead of filling every spare second with scrolling, swiping, or stressing, we allowed ourselves even five minutes a day of true stillness. What if we replaced some of our busyness with intentional pauses? Doing nothing isn‚Äôt about being idle; it‚Äôs about being present. It‚Äôs the art of tuning in, rather than tuning out. When we embrace stillness, we give ourselves the chance to hear the whispers of inspiration, to feel gratitude, and to return to our lives more grounded and clear-minded. So, next time you feel the urge to check your phone during a quiet moment, try this instead: just be. Breathe. Listen. Notice. And remember, sometimes the most productive thing you can do is absolutely nothing.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Originally published on Medium.]]></summary></entry></feed>
